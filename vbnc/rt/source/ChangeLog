	* Test.vb: Added GetTargetExtension and a field for this information.
	
2007-03-02  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Test.vb: Change the logic that determines if the test is negative or not: Now all tests that starts with at least 4 numbers are negative.

2007-03-01  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Test.vb: Don't do test executable verification if we don't have the vbc compiler.

2007-03-01  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Test.vb: Create the output directory if it doesn't exist.

2007-02-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* EnhancedProgressBar.vb, frmMain.vb, Settings.vb, TestExecutor.vb:
	  Some changes to work around vbnc bugs.

2007-02-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* frmMain.vb: Remove references to ListView.StateImageIndex, doesn't
	  seem to be implemented in winforms yet.

2007-02-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

 	* Test.vb: Don't test the selfcompiled executable (since it is supposed
	  to fail with no commandline arguments). Also update the logic to
	  determine the target of the test to support both / and -.
	* ExternalProcessVerification.vb, ExternalProcessExecutor.vb: An
	  execution now fails if the executable is not found.
	* frmMain.vb, frmMain.Designer.vb: Update references to My.Settings.
	* Settings.vb: Change MySettings to save settings in the registry
	  instead of using the default settings provider, it causes problems
	  when used with files on shared drives.

	* Test.vb: 
	- Some directory separator fixes for Linux.
	- It's now possible to specifiy a few options for the test directly on the test (to remove dependency on Parent, which isn't there when used by rt-console).
	* Helper.vb:
	- Created and moved a few functions here that are shared with rt-console.
	* Tests.vb:
	- Tests can now optionally be loaded recursively or not.
	* ExternalProcessExecutor.vb:
	- Use "mono" as executable when running on Mono.
