	* Test.vb: 
	- Some directory separator fixes for Linux.
	- It's now possible to specifiy a few options for the test directly on the test (to remove dependency on Parent, which isn't there when used by rt-console).
	* Helper.vb:
	- Created and moved a few functions here that are shared with rt-console.
	* Tests.vb:
	- Tests can now optionally be loaded recursively or not.
	* ExternalProcessExecutor.vb:
	- Use "mono" as executable when running on Mono.
