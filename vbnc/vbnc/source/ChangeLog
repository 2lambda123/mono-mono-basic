	* General/AssemblyInfo.vb: Version bump.

2007-02-20  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Expressions/MethodGroupToValueExpression.vb: Better crash message.
	* Statements/RedimClause.vb: Do some verification.
	* Members/ArraySizeInitializationModifier.vb: Resolve some type
	  references.
	* Members/ArrayElementInitializer.vb: Implement support for
	  initializing multi-dimensional arrays.
	* Tokens/Span.vb: Report relative filename in ToString().
	* General/CodeFile.vb: Add RelativePath, it's the path of the source
	  file that was given to the compiler. Used to show error messages
	  with the same filename as the compiler was given.
	* General/Helper.vb: EmitLoadArrayElement now uses the Get method on
	  the array type instead of the slower Get method on Array.
	* General/CommandLine.vb: Update signature of AddFilesInDir to support
	  CodeFile.RelativePath.
	* General/BaseObject.vb: Create ParentLocationTree, will show the
	  location of all the parents recursively.
	* Emit/Emitter.vb: Ifed out some consistency checking.

2007-02-13  Rolf Bjarne Kvinge <RKvinge@novell.com> 

	* Expressions/AddressOfExpression.vb, Expressions/GetRefExpression.vb,
	  General/Helper.vb: Make the crashes give more information.
	* Expressions/SimpleNameExpression.vb: Properties in implicit modules
	  can now be accessed correctly.
	* Expressions/Expression.vb: If getting the object reference of a
	  deref'ed value type, return the original deref'ed value type (which
	  should be a byref type, so this is ok).
	* Expressions/DeRefExpression.vb: Make the base expression publicly
	  available.
	* Expressions/DelegateOrObjectCreationExpression.vb: Only resolve the
	  argument list as a delegete argument list if it actually is a
	  delegate creation.
	* Members/PropertyDeclaration.vb: Add a call to MyBase.GenerateCode, so
	  that attributes are emitted correctly.
	* Members/ArrayElementInitializer.vb: Another check for 0 elements to
	  emit.
	* General/CommandLine.vb: Ignore any exceptions when trying to write
	  vbnc.rsp (might happen if the user doesn't have write permissions
	  to the directory where vbnc.exe resides).

	* Expressions/ArgumentList.vb, Members/MethodDeclaration.vb,
	  Code/CodeBlock.vb, TypeDeclarations/AssemblyDeclaration.vb:
	  Commented out a wrong assert.
	* Expressions/Conversions/CSByteExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CSngExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CIntExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CBoolExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CShortExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CDblExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CByteExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CULngExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CStrExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CObjExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CCharExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CDateExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CUIntExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CLngExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CTypeExpression.vb,
	  Expressions/Conversions/CUShortExpression.vb: Validate conversion
	  during the resolution phase.
	* Expressions/Conversions/CDecExpression.vb: Validate conversion during
	  the resolution phase. Add special handling for loading decimal
	  constants in a way that looks like a MS bug.
	* Expressions/SimpleNameExpression.vb: In GetMeClassification check if
	  the parent is a TypeDeclaration for fields. Fixes #80752.
	* Expressions/BinaryExpressions/EqualsExpression.vb,
	  ConditionalCompilation/ConditionalCompilation.vb: Add more debug
	  info.
	* Expressions/InvocationOrIndexExpression.vb,
	  Members/FunctionSignature.vb, Members/Parameter.vb,
	  Members/VariableDeclaration.vb, Names/QualifiedIdentifier.vb,
	  Types/TypeName.vb, General/MethodBaseDeclaration.vb: Shortcircuit
	  resolution if something fails.
	* Statements/RaiseEventStatement.vb: Override ResolveTypeReferences.
	* vbnc.vbproj: Updated.
	* Emit/Emitter.vb: Small fix to the emission stack.
	* ConditionalCompilation/ConditionalExpression.vb: Simplify code a bit
	  using the vbruntime for a few cases. Add a couple of special cases
	  since our vbruntime doesn't have support yet for the necessary
	  functions required to boot the compiler.
	* Types/TypeNameResolutionInfo.vb: Shortcircuit resolution if something
	  fails. Now shows VBNC30451 correctly.
	* Resources/GenerateCodeAndResX.bat, Resources/GenerateCodeAndResX.sh:
	  A script to generate Messages.vb and Errors.resx from Source.xml
	* Resources/Errors.resx: Add an error message for error # 30451.
	* General/CodeFile.vb: Don't try to parse the file as UTF8 by default
	  (fixes #80750). This has to be done some other way though.
	* General/Report.vb: Remove unused method.
	* General/Helper.vb: Add a function to enable debug output with
	  environment variables.
	* General/AssemblyInfo.vb: Update version.
	* General/TypeResolution.vb: Implement for cases for type conversions.
	* General/TypeConverter.vb: Add a method to get the error # (if any)
	  for a specified conversion
	* General/Compiler.vb: Fix testoutput path.
	* General/CommandLine.vb: More debug information.
	* General/Messages.vb: Add message for error #30451.

	* Scanner.vb: The scanner now scans reads characters in files one by one instead of loading the entire source file into memory at once.
	* GenericTypeDescriptor.vb: Use StringBuilder instead of concatenation to use less strings.
	* ArrayTypeDescriptor.vb: Cache FullName to avoid calculating it several times.
	* Conditional*.vb: Implement support for ConditionalAttribute. A copy of all the constants are now created every time a constant changes (so that we know what the constant was later on when we handle ConditionalAttributes). Fixed bug when conditional constants are in an excluded code-region.
	* TypeNameResolutionInfo.vb: Create less strings and temporary objects.
	* CodeFile.vb: Implement support for ConditionalAttribute.
	* Helper.vb: A few more special cases for IsEnum to avoid getting the FullName of the type. Add the ConditionalAttribute to all the Assert* calls.
	* TypeCache.vb: Only load methods from a class if the class was successfully loaded (quite a few methods are still missing this check).
